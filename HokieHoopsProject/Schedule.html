            <h1>Cassell Coliseum</h1>
            <p> The home of our basketball games, among other sports, is Cassell. Construction of the building was completed in 1964, but it wasn't until 1976 that it was named Cassell Coliseum. Additions were completed in 1988, and it now has around 10,000 seats in the house- the program often attracts capacity crowds.  The students sitting in the student section are often known as the Cassell Guard, and play a huge role in the success of our team at home games! </p>
            <h1>Hokie Nation</h1>
            <p> The fans of Virginia Tech athletics really come out and support the basketball team! Virginia Tech athletics have had such a huge fan turnout that the term Hokie Nation is now widely familiar! There is a lot of pride that goes into being a part of the Hokie Nation, and virtually nowhere else will you see maroon and orange together without a VT logo on it! The fans love their crazy color combo and all around the world you can find Virginia Tech affiliations!</p>
