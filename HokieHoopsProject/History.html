            <h1> History</h1>

            <p> January 22, 1909 was the date of the first Virginia Tech men's basketball game, played against Emory and Henry College. The Hokies won 33-26. Throughout the program's history, it has had a line of succesfull coaches including: Don DeVoe, Charles Moir, Bill Foster, Seth Greenburg, and presently Buzz Williams. DeVoe coached the 1973 win against Notre Dame that won the team the NIT (National Invitation Tournament). Under Coach Charles Moir, the team went to four NCAA tournaments. Additionally, Moir holds the all-time wins record at Virginia Tech with 213 wins. Bill Foster was the program's head coach when the team won the NIT again in 1995. Seth Greenburg had a successful 2006-2007 season when his team beat Duke at Cameron Indoor and also top-ranked UNC. Buzz Williams, previously coaching at Marquette, was hired at Virginia Tech on March 24th, 2014 and is currently bringing about a hopeful and exciting attitude leading the 2016-2017 team.



                <p> Notable players from Virginia Tech basketball are Bimbo Coles, who was in the 1988 U.S. Olympics, Ace Custis, Dell Curry (who went on to play for the Charlotte Hornets and is father of Stephen Curry), and Allan Bristow, who played for ten years in the NBA. Competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), the Virginia Tech men's basketball team is a NCAA Division 1 team with their sights on going to the ACC Championship in the spring. Through hard work, preparation, and teamwork, perhaps they will make more history!  <p> Information Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_Hokies_men's_basketball" style="color: white;" target="_blank">Virginia Tech Hokies Men's Basketball</a>, on Wikipedia.
