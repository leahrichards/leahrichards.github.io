<h1>History</h1>
<p> January 22, 1909 was the first Virginia Tech men's basketball game, played against Emory and Henry. The Hokies won 33-26. Throughout the program's history, it has had a line of succesfull coaches including: Don DeVoe, Charles Moir, Bill Foster, Seth Greenburg, and presently Buzz Williams. Previously coaching at Marquette, Buzz Williams was hired at Virginia Tech on March 24th, 2014 and is currently bringing about a hopeful and exciting attitude leading the 2016-2017 team. Notable players from Virginia Tech basketball are Bimbo Coles, who was in the 1988 U.S. Olympics, Ace Custis, Dell Curry (who went on to play for the Charlotte Hornets and is father of Stephen Curry), and Allan Bristow, who played for ten years in the NBA. Competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), the Virginia Tech men's basketball team is a NCAA Division 1 team with their sights on going to the ACC Championship in the spring. Through hard work, preparation, and teamwork, perhaps they will make more history!  Information Source(s): Wikipedia</p>

            <h1>Cassell Coliseum</h1>
            <p> The home of our basketball games, among other sports, is Cassell. Construction of the building was completed in 1964, but it wasn't until 1976 that it was named Cassell Coliseum. Additions were completed in 1988, and it now has around 10,000 seats in the house- the program often attracts capacity crowds.  The students sitting in the student section are often known as the Cassell Guard, and play a huge role in the success of our team at home games! </p>
            <h1>Hokie Nation</h1>
            <p> The fans of Virginia Tech athletics really come out and support the basketball team! Virginia Tech athletics have had such a huge fan turnout that the term Hokie Nation is now widely familiar! There is a lot of pride that goes into being a part of the Hokie Nation, and virtually nowhere else will you see maroon and orange together without a VT logo on it! The fans love their crazy color combo and all around the world you can find Virginia Tech affiliations!</p>
